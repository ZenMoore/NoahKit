# PyTorch : Acadamic Framework

Here, we don't note the basic implementation of a pipeline.\
That is to say, the fundamental usage of pytorch will not be in this notebook.\
If you are interested, please see : 
- [Tutorial : get started](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html).
- [ZenTorch : my learning code](https://github.com/ZenMoore/ZenTorch)

Here, we'll only learn advanced pytorch.
