# TensorFlow : Industrial Framework

Here, we don't note the basic implementation of a pipeline.\
That is to say, the fundamental usage of tensorflow will not be in this notebook.\
If you are interested, please see : 
- [Tutorial : quick started](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials).
- [ZenTF : my learning code](https://github.com/ZenMoore/ZenTF)

Here, we'll only learn advanced tensorflow.
