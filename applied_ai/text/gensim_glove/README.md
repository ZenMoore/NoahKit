**gensim for word2vec** and **glove for GloVe** are two packages for representing documents as semantic vectors.\
**gensim** has glove2word2vec, which can load glove to vector, but attention, there word2vec is not that classical word2vec but only a vector form...\
**gensim** : `pip install gensim` \
**glove** : `pip install glove_python` \
for windows : **glove** : [Installation Guide](https://github.com/maciejkula/glove-python/wiki/Installation-on-Windows) \
another glove model toolkit is torchtext : `from torchtext.vocab import Glove`
